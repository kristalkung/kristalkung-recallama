          Hello! My name is Kristal. I am a Research Associate working 
          in the alternative meat biotech industry and am looking to transition 
          into a software engineering role. My passion for the environment lead
          me to where I am today and I am now reaching for my next goal 🌱
          <br />
          <br />

          I really enjoy the challenges of programming and love being able to 
          make my ideas come to life. The problem solving aspect keeps me on
          my toes and I like how the industry is constantly evolving and adapting
          to the needs of world. A core value of mine is to live while positively 
          impact to the world. I believe that stepping into software engineering 
          will help me reach a wider audience to fulfill that value 🌎

          <br />
          <br />
          
          In my free time, I enjoy trying new recipes, eating at new restaurants, 
          taking long walks on the beach, running in 60 degree weather, and 
          finding the next best ice cream spot 🍦
